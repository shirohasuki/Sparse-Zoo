# GraphSAGE

## Overview

This code implements the GraphSAGE model, originally published by

  * William L. Hamilton, Rex Ying, Jure Leskovec:
    ["Inductive Representation Learning
    on Large Graphs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02216), 2017.

TensorFlow programs can import and use it as described in its
[API docs](https://github.com/tensorflow/gnn/blob/main/tensorflow_gnn/docs/api_docs/python/models/graph_sage.md).

## API stability

This model is covered by [semantic
versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) of TensorFlow GNN's
open-source releases: new minor versions do not break existing users.
