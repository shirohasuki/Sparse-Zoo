# Graph Convolutional Network

## Overview

This code implements Graph Convolutional Networks, originally published by

  * Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling:
    ["Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional
    Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907), 2016.

TensorFlow programs can import and use it as described in its
[API docs](https://github.com/tensorflow/gnn/blob/main/tensorflow_gnn/docs/api_docs/python/models/gcn.md).

## API stability

This model is covered by [semantic
versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) of TensorFlow GNN's
open-source releases: new minor versions do not break existing users.
