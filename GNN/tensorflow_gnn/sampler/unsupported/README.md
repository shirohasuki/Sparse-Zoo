# Unsupported TF-GNN Sampler

This is old TF-GNN Sampler from the 0.1 library release.



**It is deprecated and no longer supported**.


Consider new distributed
[Beam sampler](https://github.com/tensorflow/gnn/blob/main/tensorflow_gnn/docs/guide/beam_sampler.md)
and our new in-memory
[Sampling API](https://github.com/tensorflow/gnn/blob/main/tensorflow_gnn/experimental/sampler).
